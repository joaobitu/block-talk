- Add a "Block" where you can speak your mind and others can see it!
- Comment on a "Block" and discuss that specific topic!
- A Homepage to see Blocks!
- Sort the Blocks on your Homepage Toggling between global or just from who you are following!

## Practiced Skills

This was by far the most involved project I have ever done... I got to practice many many things... the most interesting of those was... planning! Usually I was doing projects with specifications already laid out... but in this case I built the specifications for it and worked from there! here is a picture of how it looked:

and it progressed from there:

until it was essentially done:

Something else that I do not usually do, was a mock-up of the design, its really rough, but... I'm not a designer haha!:

A very big deal about this project was also getting the backend to work... this was much more involved than where's waldo application I previously did... and so I got to do many interesting things such as working with authentication!

Overall it was incredibly interesting challenge.

## Improvements

A social media application in real life is incredibly complex, and it takes tens of thousands of developers years to build and maintain it... So I had to define a scope that was reasonable within my circumstances... There are however features to improve here that I could eventually do, and those are:

- ~~Making the changes to some elements of the application dynamic, in not needing to refresh to reload the content and pull the data from the backend~~
- ~~Adding the option to delete/edit Blocks (this was left out as I felt like it was something I didnt need further practicing giving I already did this in previous applications)~~
- ~~Adding further barriers to avoid displaying null content (profile page inacessible before being logged in)~~
- Adding a Different Color Scheme Option.
